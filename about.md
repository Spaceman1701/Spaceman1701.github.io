## What Even Is This Blog?
Hopefully this will be a blog where I write about the projects I am working on. You can check out my (sometimes unfinished) code on [Github](https://github.com/Spaceman1701) and [Bitbucket](https://bitbucket.org/Spaceman42/).

I'm sorry if formatting issues pop up from time to time, I am still working on fixing issues regarding code highlighting.

## About Me
My name is Ethan Hunter, and I'm currently a Computer Science student at University of Colorado in Boulder. I like to write code in my free time, and I guess I'm going to start blogging about it here!

You can email me at fcspaceman@gmail.com

  This blog uses the [Lanyon](https://github.com/poole/lanyon) theme for Jekyll. It's pretty cool!
