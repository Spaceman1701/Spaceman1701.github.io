I've neglected this blog for... almost a year. I still have a few posts in the works and some new things I want to write.
I've also finally moved this blog to my own domain [virtuallyethan.com]! If you know me, you probably know my other hobby is photography. I've decided to keep a seperate blog-style site for that as well. You can find it at [photos.virtuallyethan.com].

Hopefully I'll get a chance to keep this site a bit more active over the next year.
